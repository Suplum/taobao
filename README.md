# Company's challenge for me

#### it is an website about mall for red Wine

### I want to practice canvas

### 2d canvas draw image with drag_scale_spin material 

### 3d with three.js show wine model

### Convert 2d canvas to image url , make the image as 3d wine material with three.js

### show this demo to my boss wei

### half of me always thoughts that why not fire me,,,i can't do this demo with canvas

### canvas is not as easy to use as dom .

### but another half of me want to learn to use canvas to write somethings such as use canvas to write an piano music player demo
